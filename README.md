# DSA Journey

This repository documents my daily and weekly progress solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems using Java.  
The objective is to strengthen problem-solving fundamentals through consistent practice and well-structured solutions.

This repository also represents a personal commitment to remain consistent throughout the year and maintain regular contributions.

## Problems Solved

| # | Title | Difficulty | Link | Solution |
|--|-------|------------|------|----------|
| 1 | Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array | Easy | [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/) | [Java](./Easy/26_RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray.java) |

## Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills using Java  
- Write clean, readable, and well-commented code  
- Maintain daily consistency throughout the year  
- Build a strong foundation for technical interviews  

## Notes

Each solution includes:
- Problem link
